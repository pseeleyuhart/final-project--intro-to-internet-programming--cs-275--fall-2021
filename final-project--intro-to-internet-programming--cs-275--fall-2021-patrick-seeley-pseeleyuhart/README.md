# Fall 2021 Intro to Internet Programming — Final Project

* **Do not start this project until you have read these instructions carefully.**  
* **Read these instructions repeatedly until you understand, then begin your project. If something is not clear, ask.**  

---

## ❖・Introduction・❖
Create a *single* web page consisting of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that creates a carousel (also referred to as a slide show) of the images included in the `img` folder. A short, 21-second video of what’s required for this project is available from [http://vanegas.cs.hartford.edu/uploads/videos/cs-275/slide-show.mp4](http://vanegas.cs.hartford.edu/uploads/videos/cs-275/slide-show.mp4).

You will need to implement from scratch development and production Gulp tracks for this project. Running `gulp serve` should invoke the development track; running `gulp build` should invoke the production track.

_You may **only** work within the confines of the included scaffold._

## ❖・Rules・❖
* The user interface of your project should approximate as close as possible the rendering in the video.
* Images may not be resized.
* There should be no scroll bars, either horizontal or vertical.
* Author your code according to the included `.editorconfig` rules. (**Do not alter**.)
* Lint JavaScript according to the included `.eslintrc.json` rules. (**Do not alter**.)
* Validate HTML according to the W3 validator at `https://validator.w3.org/`.
* Validate/lint CSS according to the included `.stylelintrc.json` rules. (**Do not alter**.)
* Do not add images.
* Keep the default font size to 16 pixels
* Set the content leading to 1.125 × default font size
* Set the font size of H1 to 32 pixels
* Set the leading of the H1 to 1.2 × the H1 font size
* Set the top and bottom padding of the images to 15 pixels. (**Exclude the arrow images from this rule.**)
* Set the left and right padding of the images to 18 pixels. (**Exclude the arrow images from this rule.**)
* Do not use any CSS or JavaScript libraries.
* You’re free to shape any of the `.gitignore` files to your needs.
